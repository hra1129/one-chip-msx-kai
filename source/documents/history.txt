1chipMSX-Kai Update History

xx/xx/2021 (ocmkai-xxxxxxxx.zip)
    (1) Fixed a bug that caused the RTC time to deviate by about one second per minute.
    (2) Rewrote RTC from VHDL to Verilog (Reduced circuit size)
    (3) Rewrote MemoryMapper from VHDL to Verilog (Reduced circuit size)
    (4) Added internal ROM/RAM mapping function to PanaMegaCon.
    (5) Added the ability to make MapperRAM's BIOS copy location write-protected.
    (6) Added DRAM mode.
    (7) Changed the unused LED8 to a turbo mode indicator.
    (8) The unused DIP-SW9 was changed to a built-in software switching switch.
    (9) Implemented the CR bit in register 15 of the RTC.
    (10) Fixed a1gt.cfg/a1st.cfg in BIOS Image Maker so that it does not load unnecessarily.

    Known issue:
      When using FS-A1GT BIOS, A1 cockpit does not start with "CALL MWP".
      The built-in software switch doesn't work either.

    Memo:
      Using FS-A1ST BIOS, the A1 cockpit is activated by a built-in software switch. 
      Word processing software is also available. "CALL HIRO" also works.

2nd/September/2020 (ocmkai-20200902.zip)
    (1) modified opll/voicerom.vhd
        Changed the notation of ROM to hexadecimal numbers.
        Copy the ROM data from YM2413Burczynski.cc in OpenMSX 16.0.

    (2) modified ocm-kai_default.cof
        Fixed a part of the absolute path description.

    (3) modified Japanese keymap in keymap.vhd.LANGUAGE.

11th/August/2020 (ocmkai-20200811.zip)
    (1) Fixed a bug in ocm_bus_selector.
        Modified JIS Kanji Level1 I/O port address.
        Fixed a bug that caused a wrong I/O address when separating from emsx_top.

    (2) Modified 'tool/bios_image_maker/roms/*.cfg'.
        Fixed the bug that the address of KanjiROM data allocation was wrong.
        Added a setting to enable JIS Kanji Level 2.

10th/August/2020 (ocmkai-20200810.zip)
    (1) Fixed a bug in PanasonicMegaROM.
        Modified write register address for memory bank 5 and 6.

    (2) The VDP was reverted to the OCM-PLD 3.8.1 version.
        The new VDP core has added a number of bugs in exchange for 
        subtle sprite display improvements. For that reason, 
        we decided to bring it back once. 
        The new VDP core has been moved to video/backup.

    (3) Modified 'tool/bios_image_maker/roms/fsa1gt.cfg'.
        Because there was a mistake that the ROM of the start-up logo 
        was not placed in slot0-3 and the kanji driver was not 
        installed, it was corrected.

5th/August/2020 2nd (ocmkai-20200805_2.zip)
    (1) Fixed a bug that may cause the app to hang at startup.

    (2) Added LinearROM mode to PanasonicMegaROM.
        LinearROM is default.

5th/August/2020 (ocmkai-20200805.zip)
    (1) Improved the behavior of S1990.
        Fixed how to switch between the two T80a's.

    (2) PanasonicMegaROM is impremented and connected to slot3-3.

    (3) Fixed a wiring error due to Verilogization of emsx_top (BugFIX)

    (4) Fixed the detachment method of IPL-ROM.
        Changed the timing of access to the primary slot register 
        so that it is separated from the primary slot register 
        not at the access timing of the primary slot register, 
        but at the time of 0000h reading after IPL-ROM execution 
        is completed.

    (5) Impremented I/O port A7h.
        Implemented only the pause related latch part of TurboR.

    (6) IPL-ROM v4.0.2
        Support for new IPL-ROM detachment and the primary slot initializing methods.

    (7) Added step execution for debug.

    (8) Added a method of initializing the primary slot register (A8h) to 00h at first startup.

27th/June/2020 (ocmkai-20200627.zip)

    (1) Organize the source code hierarchy.

23th/May/2020 (ocmkai-20200523.zip)
    (1) OCM-PLD3.7.1 to 3.8 fixes have been incorporated.
    (2) Several circuits that had been laid flat on the emsx_top were separated into separate levels.
    (3) Corrected a misstatement of MSX-MUSIC BIOS in bluemsx_*.cfg, which is a sample setting value of bios_image_maker.

20th/May/2020 (ocmkai-20200520.zip)
    (1) Added "OCM-Kai control device"
    (2) Expanded available SDRAM space from 8MB to 32MB
    (3) Added support for CHANGE_ESERAM_MEMORY in IPLROM4.
    (4) Change the arrangement on SDRAM.
    (5) Update the cfg file for bios_image_maker to match the new SDRAM map.

        -- SDRAM is divided into 32 areas in 1MB units and assigned a number corresponding to eseram_memory_id.
        -- The OCM-Kai control device is equipped with a register to select the area to be connected to the MegaSDHC.
        -- tool\bios_image_maker\roms\*.cfg
           [WARNING] The BIOS image file on the SD card and on the EPCS must be updated to match the new deployment.

7th/May/2020 (ocmkai-20200507.zip)
    (1) Added new SDRAM clearing circuit.

        -- This is an initialization circuit that sets only the first two bytes of 
           ESE-RAM, ESE-SCC1, ESE-SCC2, and MAIN-RAM to 0000h.

5th/May/2020 (ocmkai-20200505.zip)
    (1) Modified vdp_registers.vhd
          REG_SP_OFF initial parameter changed to 0 from 1.

    (2) SDRAM controller is separated from the emsx_top hierarchy.
    (3) Removed the circuit that clears SDRAM at startup.

        -- A circuit to clear a part of SDRAM (MainRAM, ESERAM, etc.) 
           to zero at startup was included, but it was not functioning 
           properly and only the first 1 byte was cleared.
        -- The real MSX does not have the hardware to zero-clear DRAM/VRAM.

2nd/May/2020 (ocmkai-20200502.zip)
    (1) Modified keymap.vhd for Japanese 106 keyboard.

          PS/2 Keyboard --> MSX Key
          [Zen/Han]     --> [ESC]
          [F6]          --> [STOP]
          [F7]          --> [CLS/HOME]
          [LeftWIN]     --> [Kana]
          [Menu]        --> [INS]

1st/May/2020 (ocmkai-20200501.zip)
    (1) The Kana indicator was changed from NumLk LED to ScrLk LED.
    (2) Add the description of NumLk status maintenance.

          Some compact keyboards without numeric keypad use NumLk LED ON/OFF 
          to switch the right side of the full keypad to numeric keypad mode. 
          When using the NumLk LED as a kana LED, the right side of the keyboard 
          changed to the numeric keypad when it was in kana mode, and it did not 
          work as expected.
    (3) Added sample of BIOS Image Maker.
          tool\bios_image_maker\roms\*.cfg
          tool\bios_image_maker\roms\make_all.bat

28th/Apr./2020 (ocmkai-20200428.zip)
    (1) IPLROM has been updated.
        IPLROM v4.00
          The structure of BIOS images placed in the serial ROM and SD card is changed.
          It works as long as only the necessary ROM is recorded.
          The ON/OFF of IPLROM message at the time of starting can be controlled.
          PAL and NTSC selectable.
          The ROM area where FFh is laid out can be processed at high speed.
          Can write to I/O ports.
    (2) The MSX-MIDI receiver is still under construction.

23th/Feb./2020 (ocmkai-20200223.zip)
    (1) Added MSX-MIDI interface.
        -- But not impremented the MIDI-IN yet.
    (2) Modified external interrupt signal.
        -- pSltInt changed from input / output port to input port.
        -- Changed to notify the CPU of the interrupt signal input from pSltInt.

26th/Jan./2020 (ocmkai-20200126.zip)
    (1) Adjust V-sync interrupt timing.

25th/Jan./2020 (ocmkai-20200125.zip)
    (1) Provide feedback on corrections to OCM-PLD v3.8.
    (2) Verilog conversion of some circuits of vdp.
        vdp_vga, vdp_hvcounter, vdp_ssg, vdp_sprite, vdp_linebuf, vdp_doublebuf.
    (3) Updated vdp_sprite. Fixed a bug that MSX2 + logo display was distorted.

16th/Jan./2020 (ocmkai-20200116.zip)
    (1) Added BIOS reading progress display function to IPL-ROM. [by caro]
    (2) The vdp_sprite has been significantly overhauled, 
        and fixed two lines from register switching to display.
        However, the bug that MSX2 + logo display is disturbed remains.
    (3) Added 1chipMSX-Kai Logo.
